# TODO

[ ] Tuning, once built in box:
  [ ] Filter tilt
  [ ] Position tilt
  [ ] Touch scaling to amplitude
    - also accounting for delay volume
  [ ] feedback at maximum open

[ ] don't cycle short samples - make one-shots

[x] Calibration display should have top priority

[ ] Filter and open/close
  [x] limit upper edge of filter (perhaps drop Q?) so no overflow
  [-] NOPE: reduce top gain on samples?
  [-] NOPE: when lid is 45Â° need to swap to Z not X (and now signal open)

[ ] Delay
  [x] does it need wed/dry code?
    [x] w/o it, is there too much delay
    [x] with it, does it no longer sound right?
    [x] with it, do you need the all pass code or is simple delay enough?
    - with wet/dry in, and set all wet, there seems to be no lag: still hear
    - the dry sound first.  at half wet/dry, there is deminishing I think
    - because of phase offset?
    - SCRAP the allpass - straight delay line works GREAT!
  [x] does it need the linear interp? NOPE
  [x] does it need DC leaking code? NOPE
  [x] noise burst on start? 'twas the filter ctor values!
  [x] noisy when delay changes - need better calc?
  [x] still need the clamp on the tank?
  [ ] does half speed delay line work well?
  [x] can changing the calculation format improve anything?

[ ] blinking yellow for "will load" is hard to see
[ ] finder should re-search a few MS after last change to FS

[x] how much code is FS init taking up?
  about 7k

HW:
[x] go back to 1M touch resistors
[-] revisit opAmp gain - maybe more?
[x] check wiring from LiPo port on CPE+
[~] work out wiring harnesses

[ ] on board speaker toggle
  [ ] start with off? or on? depends on how loud it is in the box....

[ ] how to keep lid open without holding it


## Later

[] on open lid, invert env.

[] Lightshow of some sort?


## Future

[ ] why is 12kHz sampling actually 13.7kHz?
[ ] DMA and FatFile issue?
