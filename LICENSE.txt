In order to format the FatFS on the flash drive like SdFat_format does, this
project also contains a copy of some of elm-chan's FatFs source. It is in the
`elm-chan` directory and retains its own copyright and license.

This project makes use of the FixedPoints library, which asks me to let you
know that it is published under an Apache 2.0 license.
